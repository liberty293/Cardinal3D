We have implemented all the basic operations, and the following advanced operations:
* Boundary edge collapse
* Erase vertex
* Erase edge

We implemented a function `edge_collapsable` to check whether collapsing an edge will result in an unsatisfying mesh. This function is used by `simplify` to skip edges that should not be collapsed
